# Elevation Analysis - Day 3

## Key Findings
- Lowest elevation wards: 108: 2.46, 109: 4.17, 57: 4.78, 107: 5.09, 58: 5.10
- Correlation with initial risk assessment: 108, 109, 107 were previously marked as high/medium risk wards, and have the lowest elevations.
- Unexpected findings: 61, 74, 93 were considered high-risk, yet have higher elevations. 57 and 58 are considered low-risk despite having low elevations.

## Next Steps for Day 4
- Add rainfall data
- Calculate distance to water bodies
- Begin feature engineering for ML model
