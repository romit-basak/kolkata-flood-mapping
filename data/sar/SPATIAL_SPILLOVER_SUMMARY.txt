SPATIAL SPILLOVER ANALYSIS - SUMMARY
Date: November 19, 2025

CRITICAL FINDING: Buffer zone lost 4.7x more water than KMC

1. BUFFER ZONE LOSS: 2.69 km² (82% of total)
   - 2014-2016: 3.58 km²
   - 2023-2025: 0.90 km²
   - Decline: 74.9%

2. KMC INTERNAL LOSS: 0.57 km² (18% of total)
   - 2014-2016: 0.84 km²
   - 2023-2025: 0.27 km²
   - Decline: 67.8%

3. SPATIAL FEATURES (for model):
   - internal_loss_km2: 0.57 km² total
   - buffer_loss_3km_km2: Mean=0.0266, Max=1.77 km²
   - neighbor_loss_km2: 0.0000 km² total
   - total_drainage_exposure: Weighted composite

4. CONCENTRATION:
   - 4 wards significantly affected
   - Ward 108 + Ward 58 account for majority
   - Eastern KMC boundary (near wetlands)

5. HYDROLOGICAL INSIGHT:
   - Municipal boundaries don't constrain water movement
   - External drainage loss PRIMARY driver (82%)
   - Traditional ward-only analysis misses dominant factor

EXPECTED MODEL IMPACT: 15-20% feature importance for buffer_loss_3km_km2
